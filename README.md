This project is a user-friendly solution for showcasing a Realtor's properties on a webpage. It utilizes <b>Node.js</b> and <b>Facebook's Graph API</b> to automatically retrieve and display the Realtor's Facebook posts on the website. <b>TypeScript</b> and <b>React</b> are employed to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability.

A standout feature is its SEO optimization and enhanced user experience, thanks to the integration of <b>Next.js</b> for server-side rendering (SSR), significantly improving performance and SEO ranking. The Realtor doesn't need to be involved, as everything is managed by the API function.

The original repository is <a href="https://github.com/fred-gutierrez">here</a>, with the appropriate commit history and changes made before the <b>Next.js</b> export on the 17th of October, 2023.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The Realtor's Properties Display Webpage is designed to streamline the process of presenting the Realtor's properties in an attractive and user-friendly manner. To achieve this, the following key features and technologies were utilized:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Facebook's Graph API Integration</b> - The project integrates with Facebook's Graph API to fetch the Realtor's Facebook posts, which likely contain details about the properties she wants to showcase. By leveraging the Graph API, the solution ensures that the webpage automatically stays up-to-date with the latest posts on the Realtor's Facebook page.</li>
<li><b>Eye-catching Image Carousel</b> - We've implemented an Image Carousel to showcase the Realtor's properties in a visually captivating way. This dynamic carousel leaves a lasting impression on the visitors, making property browsing an engaging experience.</li>
<li><b>Node.js Backend</b> - NodeJS is used to create a robust backend that handles the interaction with the Facebook Graph API. The backend is responsible for fetching and filtering the relevant data from the API, ensuring that only the Realtor's property-related posts are displayed on the webpage.</li> 
<li><b>TypeScript for Maintainability</b> - TypeScript is employed throughout the project to add static typing to the JavaScript codebase. This helps catch potential errors during development, makes the codebase more maintainable.</li>
<li><b>Tailwind CSS for Styling</b> - Tailwind CSS is used as the styling framework for the project, ensuring a sleek and modern design.</li>
<li><b>Next.js Implementation</b> - We've harnessed the power of Next.js to bring several advantages to this project. Next.js offers efficient routing, which makes navigation seamless for users. It also contributes to SEO optimization by enabling server-side rendering (SSR), which significantly improves performance and search engine ranking. This implementation ensures that the Realtor's properties are not only beautifully presented but also easily discoverable online.</li>
